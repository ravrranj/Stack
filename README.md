# Stack
Understanding the logic of one of the most important and Useful Data structure 


🧱 What is a Stack?
Think of a stack like a pile of plates 🍽️.
You add a plate on top → you remove a plate from the top.
That’s how Stack works — Last In, First Out (LIFO).

🔁 Core Stack Operations:
push(x) → Add element x to the top

pop() → Remove and return the top element

peek() / top() → Just view the top element without removing

isEmpty() → Check if the stack is empty

📦 Java Stack Basics
Java has a built-in Stack class inside java.util.Stack.
